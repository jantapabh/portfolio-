            <p>From an early age I have always been deeply interested in computing. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do. There is not only one reason but there are several reasons why I want study Software Engineering at university. I always enjoy a challenge, and can work well under pressure; my other strengths are a strong commitment to customer services, and attention to detail. I am highly motivated and enjoy challenges within a new or existing role.</p>
